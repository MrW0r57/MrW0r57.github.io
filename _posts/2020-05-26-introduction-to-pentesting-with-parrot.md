So lets' get started ........

**I am assuming that you have basic knowledge of linux, Windows, and Networking.**

## Introduction to Parrot OS-----

Parrot is a debian based operating system comes with many pentesting tools and utilities which help you to perform pentesing and forensic operations easily.

**Parrot includes different flavours like:**
 1.Parrot Security (install it to folow this blog and learn pentesting) 
 2.Parrot Home
 3.Parrot Air
 4.Parrot cloud
 5.Parrot IOT
 
**Why parrot ?**
 
 1. Its lightweight and easy to use.
 2. Features which are quite simple and versatile.
 3. Low usage of resources
 4. It has inbuilt privacy tools
 
 **Below are the fearures of Parrot security OS**
 
 1.Inbuit pentesting tools
 2.Inbuilt Forensics tools
 3.Inbuilt coding environment and utilities
 4.Inbuilt cryptography tools
 5.Secure distro within sandbox
 6.etc
 
**Download iso and vm image from (here)[https://parrotsec.org/download/]**
 
**Process to install Parrot OS**
