## Introduction
Hello readers, this is the introduction of my Pentesting blog module PWP(Pentesting with parrot os), i am gonna write blogs of most of the concepts and techniques to help beginners and enthusiasts.
So lets' get started ........

**I am assuming that you have basic knowledge of linux, Windows, and Networking.**

## Introduction to Parrot OS

Parrot is a debian based operating system comes with many pentesting tools and utilities which help you to perform pentesing and forensic operations easily.

**Parrot includes different flavours like:**
 1. Parrot Security (install it to folow this blog and learn pentesting)
 2. Parrot Home
 3. Parrot Air
 4. Parrot cloud
 5. Parrot IOT
 
**Why parrot ?**
 
 1. Its lightweight and easy to use.
 2. Features which are quite simple and versatile.
 3. Low usage of resources
 4. It has inbuilt privacy tools
 
 **Below are the fearures of Parrot security OS**
 
 1. Inbuit pentesting tools
 2. Inbuilt Forensics tools
 3. Inbuilt coding environment and utilities
 4. Inbuilt cryptography tools
 5. Secure distro within sandbox
 6. etc

**Download iso and vm image from [here](https://parrotsec.org/download/)**
 
**Process to install Parrot OS**

1. [Installation in Virtual Machine](https://ojoiszy.com/install-parrot-security-os-virtualbox/)

2. [Installation in Host Machine](https://codepoisoner.blogspot.com/p/how-to-install-parrot-security-os-step.html)

**_Hope guys you have installed parrot sec OS succesfully_**
