## Docker installation and basic use in Pentesting

## Introduction

In this module we are going to learn docker,  nowdays its become more useful for everyone . You can build and deploy services
in it in the form container.
It allows you to customize,clone you own container, and also you can push/upload customized image on docker hub.
We can build our penetration testing image easily and use it smoothly in docker.
If you want to build a penetration testing lab, its very easy to set up in docker then your host system.
So lets start..


## What is Docker ?

Docker is container technology which provide platform as a service that use OS level virtualization to deliver software in packages known as containers.

You can create one or more container from one os image and customize them as per your need, containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.


## Step by Step installation
~~~
# apt install docker.io docker docker-engine
~~~
After successfull installation of docker enable it.
~~~
# service docker enable
~~~
And start docker 
~~~
# service docker start
~~~
You can also disable it 
~~~
# service docker disable
~~~
you can also stop docker temporarily
~~~
# service docker stop
~~~
## Docker images


Images in docker are packaged services or environments, like iso images to boot the system.  Images are created with the build command, and they'll produce a container when started with run. Images are stored in a Docker registry such as registry.hub.docker.com

_**To list docker images simply run command**_

~~~
# docker images -a
~~~

_**Docker container**_

Docker is an instance of an image, container is an instance of a classâ€”a runtime object. 

_**To list all containers **_

~~~
# docker ps -a
~~~

## Building linux containers to use in docker 


**All you have to execute a simple command based on your need or can search containers on hub.docker.com.**

Example if you want to install ubuntu 32 bit container then pull 32 bit ubuntu image

~~~
# docker -h

# docker pull m0elnx/ubuntu-32bit
~~~

This will pull the image in your system and now you can launch your instance from it


it - interactive terminal
name - to put a name of your instance

~~~
# docker images -a

# docker run -it --name hacker m0elnx/ubuntu-32bit
~~~

you can stop it using 
~~~
# exit
~~~

if you want start it again 

~~~
# docker start hacker

# docker attach hacker
~~~


_**And now you are able to use your new os in 2 seconds**_

**What about use kali instance in docker **

_simply install as above_

~~~
# docker pull kalilinux/kali-linux-docker
~~~

~~~
# docker run -it --name elitehacker kalilinux/kali-linux-docker
~~~

**you can install parrot sec also**

~~~
# docker pull parrotsec/security
~~~
~~~
# docker run -it --name hactivist parrotsec/security
~~~
