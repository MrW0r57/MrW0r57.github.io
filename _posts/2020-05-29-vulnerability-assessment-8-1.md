## Network vulnerability assessment


## Introduction

In this blog post, we will learn about vulnerability assessment, how to perform, and tools to perform a vulnerability assessment.


**What is Vulnerability Assessment ?**


Vulnerability Assessment is the process, that we used to sort the vulnerability list present in the target system.
We exploit the target system using found vulnerabilities and loopholes in the target system.


**How to do Vulnerability Assessment?**

We can do a vulnerability assessment in two ways:

_**Manualy: Using our previous finding in target system.**_

_**Automated: Using Vulnerability Assessment tool.**_


We have discussed sensitive findings of target network using manual approaches, in this blog we will discuss automated network assessment tools and how to use them.



Nmap vulnerability scanning
-------------------------------

As we have discussed Nmap is a powerful tool, we can also use it to scan vulnerabilities in the target system.


```
# nmap --script vulners -sV <TargetIP>
```

Or you can also specify particular ports to scan for vulnerabilities.

```
# nmap --script vulners -sV -p 21-443 <TargetIP>
```

If you want to run all vulnerability scan in Nmap script

```
# nmap --script vuln <TargetIP>
```

It will run all scripts against target and give valuable results...



**Vulnerability Assessment Through Metaspoit** 

Metasploit-framework is a powerful tool, we can use it also to perform vulnerability assessment against the target.



**Using openvas in metasploit**

openvas comes preconfigured in Parrot-OS, we can use it directly or integrate it with the Metasploit framework.

Set openvas credentials 

```
# openvasmd -- -user=admin -- -new-password=password
```

Run msfconsole

```
# msfconsole
```

**To run msfconsole, you need load it first**

```
msf5 > load openvas
[*] Welcome to OpenVAS integration by kost and averagesecurityguy.
[*] 
[*] OpenVAS integration requires a database connection. Once the 
[*] database is ready, connect to the OpenVAS server using openvas_connect.
[*] For additional commands use openvas_help.
[*] 
[*] Successfully loaded plugin: OpenVAS 
```
List commands

```
msf5 > openvas_help
```
Connect openvas

```
msf5 > openvas_connect <openvas username> <openvas password> <host port> <ssl-confirm>
```

```
msf5 >  openvas_connect admin password localhost 9900 ok
```

register target to scan

```
msf5 > openvas_target_create “Dushman” 192.168.0.1 “Myscan”
```
Now check openvas config list

```
msf5 > openvas_config_list
```


check target list

```
msf5 > openvas_target_list
```

And create a task 


```
openvas_task_create <scanname> <comment> <scanconfig ID> <targetID>
```

```
msf5 > openvas_task_create Dushman Myscan  3 1
```
And start task

```
openvas_task_start <taskID>
```


```
msf5 > openvas_task_start 0
```

to check task list and status

```
msf5 > open_vas_list
```

After completing the scan collect report

```
msf5 > openvas_report_list 
```

You can collect report in many file formats

```
msf5 > openvas_format_list
```
To collect the report below is the syntax

```
openvas_report_download <report id> <format id> <path for saving report> <report name>
```
Lets collect report in html.

```
msf5 > openvas_report_download 1 2 ~/Desktop dushman
```

It's done check it on your desktop



**Using Nessus in Metasploit**

Download nessus free trial software for linux to see its working [click here](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-professional/evaluate)

And follow its configuration setup from [here](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/ConfigureNessus.htm)


**Run msfconsole in your terminal**

```
# msfconsole
```

```
msf5 > load Nessus
[*] Nessus Bridge for Metasploit
[*] Type nessus_help for a command listing
[*] Successfully loaded plugin: Nessus
```

```
msf5 > nessus_help
```


Now connect it with the localhost to start the scan.

```
nessus_connect <Your Username>:<Your Password>@localhost:8834 <ok>
```
To list nessus policies

```
msf5 > nessus_policy_list
```
It will show you 

```
ID  Name                    Comments
--  ----                    ---------
2   Internal Network Scan
3   External Network Scan
```


**Now scan target network**

```
msf5 > nessus_scan_new <policy ID> <scan name> <Target IP>
```


```
msf5 > nessus_scan_new 2 Myscan 10.10.10.189
```

To check the scan status

```
msf5 > nessus_scan_status
```

It will automatically create a scan report, to check

```
msf5 > nessus_report_list
```

And collect your report 

```
msf5 > nessus_report_get <report id>
```

You can also use Nessus directly I just additionally show you how to integrate Nessus with Metasploit.



## Conclusion

_**We have learned network VA from this blog post, use Nessus GUI also on your localhost, follow above links.**_
