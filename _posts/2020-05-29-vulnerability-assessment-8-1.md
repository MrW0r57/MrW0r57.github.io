## Network vulnerability assessment


## Introduction

In this blog post we will learn about vulnerability assessment, how to perform, and tools to perform vulnerability assessment.


**What is Vulnerability Assessment ?**


Vulnerability Assessment is the process, that we used to sort vulnerabilty list present in target system.
We exploit target system using found vulnerabilities and loopholes in target system.


**How to do Vulnerability Assessment ? **

We can do vulnerabilty assessment in two ways:

_**Manualy : Using our previous finding in target system.**_

_**Automated : Using Vulnerability Assessment tool.**_


We have discused sensitive findings of target network using manual approaches, in this blog we will discuss automated network assessment tools and how to use them.



Nmap vulnerability scanning
-------------------------------

As we have discussed Nmap is powerful tool, we can also use it to scan vulnerabilities in target system.


```
# nmap --script vulners -sV <TargetIP>
```

Or you can also specify particular ports to scan for vulerabilities.

```
# nmap --script vulners -sV -p 21-443 <TargetIP>
```

If you want to run all vulnerabilty scan in nmap script

```
# nmap --script vuln <TargetIP>
```

It will run all scripts against target and give valuable result..



**Vulnerability Assessment Through Metaspoit** 

Metasploit-framework is a powerful tool, we can use it also to perform vulnerabilty assessment against target.



**Using openvas in metasploit**

openvas comes preconfigured in Parrot-OS, we can use it directly or integrate it with metasploit framework.

Set openvas credentials 

```
# openvasmd -- -user=admin -- -new-password=password
```

Run msfconsole

```
# msfconsole
```

**To run msfconsole, you need load it first**

```
msf5 > load openvas
[*] Welcome to OpenVAS integration by kost and averagesecurityguy.
[*] 
[*] OpenVAS integration requires a database connection. Once the 
[*] database is ready, connect to the OpenVAS server using openvas_connect.
[*] For additional commands use openvas_help.
[*] 
[*] Successfully loaded plugin: OpenVAS 
```
List commands

```
msf5 > openvas_help
```
Connect openvas

```
msf5 > openvas_connect <openvas username> <openvas password> <host port> <ssl-confirm>
```

```
msf5 >  openvas_connect admin password local host 9900 ok
```

register target to scan

```
msf5 > openvas_target_create “Dushman” 192.168.0.1 “Myscan”
```
Now check openvas config list

```
msf5 > openvas_config_list
```


check target list

```
msf5 > openvas_target_list
```

And create a task 


```
openvas_task_create <scanname> <comment> <scanconfig ID> <targetID>
```

```
msf5 > openvas_task_create Dushman Myscan  3 1
```
And start task

```
openvas_task_start <taskID>
```


```
msf5 > openvas_task_start 0
```

to check task list and status

```
msf5 > open_vas_list
```

After completing the scan collect report

```
msf5 > openvas_report_list 
```

You can collect report in many file formats

```
msf5 > openvas_format_list
```
To collect report below is the syntax

```
openvas_report_download <report id> <format id> <path for saving report> <report name>
```
Lets collect report in html.

```
msf5 > openvas_report_download 1 2 ~/Desktop dushman
```

It's done check it on your desktop



**Using nessus in metasploit**

Download nessus free trial software for linux to see its working [click here](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-professional/evaluate)

And follow its configuration setup from [here](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/ConfigureNessus.htm)


**Run msfconsole in your terminal**

```
# msfconsole
```

```
msf5 > load nessus
[*] Nessus Bridge for Metasploit
[*] Type nessus_help for a command listing
[*] Successfully loaded plugin: Nessus
```

```
msf5 > nessus_help
```


Now connect it with local host to start scan.

```
nessus_connect <Your Username>:<Your Password>@localhost:8834 <ok>
```
To list nessus policies

```
msf5 > nessus_policy_list
```
It will show you 

```
ID  Name                    Comments
--  ----                    ---------
2   Internal Network Scan
3   External Network Scan
```


**Now scan target network**

```
msf5 > nessus_scan_new <policy ID> <scan name> <Target IP>
```


```
msf5 > nessus_scan_new 2 Myscan 10.10.10.189
```

To check scan status

```
msf5 > nessus_scan_status
```

It will automatically create a scan report, to check

```
msf5 > nessus_report_list
```

And collect your report 

```
msf5 > nessus_report_get <report id>
```

You can also use nessus directly  i just additionaly show you how to integrate nessus with metasploit.
